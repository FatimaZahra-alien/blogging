      <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold mb-6 text-center">Debugging Life — One Error at a Time</h1>

      <p className="mb-6">
        Life and code have something in common — neither runs perfectly the first time. 
        We all start with messy scripts, undefined variables, and missing imports in our story. 
        But as we grow, we begin to refactor, comment, and make sense of it all.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-6">
        When I first began coding, I thought errors meant failure. I’d stare at a red terminal, feeling 
        like I wasn’t made for this. But then I realized — those red lines aren’t stop signs; they’re teachers. 
        Every bug carries a message. Every error tells you, “There’s something to learn here.” 
        Just like in life.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">💡 The Lesson Behind the Bug</h2>

      <p className="mb-6">
        The best part about debugging is that it teaches patience. It forces you to look deeper than the surface. 
        Sometimes, what looks like a syntax error is actually a missing connection — in code, or in you. 
        Through every crash and every restart, I’ve learned to slow down, to take a breath before I re-run the program, 
        and to understand what’s really causing the issue.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">🧠 Balancing Logic and Emotion</h2>

      <p className="mb-6">
        People often think coders are purely logical — all zeros and ones. But the truth is, there’s an artist behind every 
        clean interface, and a poet behind every function that works beautifully. Coding, like art, requires emotion. 
        You need passion to build. You need empathy to design.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-6">
        So when I write code, I’m not just solving problems; I’m expressing myself — one bracket, one pixel, one thought at a time.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">🌸 Finding Meaning in the Debugging Process</h2>

      <p className="mb-6">
        The reason I named this blog <strong>“Debugging Life”</strong> is because that’s exactly what I’m doing — learning, fixing, rewriting, and improving.
        Some days, my code (and my thoughts) run smoothly. Other days, everything crashes, and I need to take a long break 
        to find the missing semicolon of peace. 
      </p>

      <p className="mb-6">
        But I’ve realized something: perfection isn’t the goal — progress is. Every new project, every failed attempt, 
        every “I’ll try again tomorrow” — that’s growth. That’s debugging life.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">💬 Final Thoughts</h2>

      <p className="mb-6">
        If you’re reading this, maybe you’re also trying to figure things out — in code, or in life. 
        And that’s okay. None of us were born experts. The goal isn’t to avoid errors — it’s to learn how to handle them gracefully.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-6">
        So next time life throws an error, don’t panic. Just open your mental console, read the message, 
        and fix it with love. Because one day, everything will compile beautifully. 💻🌿
